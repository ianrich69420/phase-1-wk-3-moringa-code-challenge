# Movie Theater!

# Description

This is the project made for the third code challenge for Moringa School.

In this project is a website in which a user can:

- See the first movie's details, including its **poster, title, runtime,
   showtime, and available tickets** when the page loads.

- See a menu of all movies on the left side of the page element when the page loads.

-  Buy a ticket for a movie. After clicking the "Buy Ticket" button, I should
   see the number of available tickets decreasing on the frontend. I should not
   be able to buy a ticket if the showing is sold out (if there are 0 tickets
   available). 

## Extra Features

- A user will be able to click on a movie in the menu to replace the currently displayed movie's details with the new movie's details.
